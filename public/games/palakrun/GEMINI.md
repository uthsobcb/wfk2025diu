> Build a **minimum viable product (MVP)** of a 2D **Temple Run-style platformer game** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external libraries)**. The player character will be represented by an image (which will be provided separately).
>
> **Core Features:**
>
> * Side-scrolling **infinite runner** gameplay on a 2D platform.
> * The character continuously runs forward.
> * Implement **jumping** (on spacebar or touch).
> * Procedurally generate simple rectangular **obstacles** the player must jump over.
> * Detect **collision** between character and obstacles.
> * End the game on collision and display **“Game Over”**.
> * Use **basic CSS for styling** and a **canvas or DOM elements** for rendering.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * No game engines or external frameworks.
> * Use only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.
> * Character should be rendered using an `img` tag or drawn on canvas from a source image.
