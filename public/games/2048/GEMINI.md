## Project Overview
Create a fully functional 2048 game with the following core requirements and features.

## Game Mechanics

### Basic Rules
- **Grid**: 4x4 game board with numbered tiles
- **Starting State**: Begin with two tiles (value 2 or 4) randomly placed
- **Movement**: Use arrow keys or WASD to slide tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right)
- **Tile Merging**: When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with doubled value
- **New Tile Generation**: After each valid move, spawn a new tile (90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4) in a random empty position
- **Win Condition**: Reach the 2048 tile
- **Lose Condition**: No valid moves available (grid full and no possible merges)

### Movement Logic
- All tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction
- Tiles merge only once per move
- Merging occurs in the direction of movement
- Score increases by the value of merged tiles

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
- Responsive game grid display
- Smooth tile animations for movement and merging
- Score tracking and display
- Game over and win state detection
- New game/restart functionality
- Undo functionality (optional)

### User Interface
- Clean, modern design with intuitive controls
- Visual feedback for tile movements
- Score display and best score persistence
- Game status messages (win/lose/continue)
- Mobile-friendly touch controls

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient grid state management
- Smooth animations (60fps target)
- Minimal memory footprint
- Fast game state calculations

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture
- Separate game logic from presentation layer
- Use appropriate data structures for grid management
- Implement proper event handling for user input
- Include comprehensive error handling

### Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Include comprehensive comments
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper testing coverage

### Platform Considerations
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile device support
- Keyboard and touch input handling
- Local storage for score persistence

## Deliverables
- Fully functional 2048 game
- Source code with documentation
- Basic test suite
- README with setup and gameplay instructions
